# CS LoadLast
Main menu modification for **S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky**

This micro mod adds a "**Last Save**" menu item to the top of the main menu, which loads the latest save game. 

*It also probably has a feature that crashes the game nicely when there are no save games present (untested).*

Built upon and probably requires **Sky Reclamation Project (SRP) v1.1.2** community patch.

Compatibility with vanilla or any other mods have not been tested. It will surely override any other main menu mods if you just copy the files over.

Commit history includes the original (unmodded) files from SRP, so you can see exactly what has been changed and merge the files yourself if need be.
